## Wordle solver

Use the solver with

~~~console
wordle-solve
~~~

You will be asked for your initial guess and for the outcome. Use 0 for a gray
tile, 1 for a yellow one and 2 for a green one. You will be suggested the next
word to try. Use it and then report the outcome. Hopefully you will get the word
you are looking for in less than 6 moves ðŸ™‚. Tests show that the solution is
correctly guessed in over 95% of the cases.
